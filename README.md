Script Addon Blockstate Json Generator
======================================


Summary
-------

A simple program to generate blockstate json files for NCO script addons. The first program argument is the type of block to generate for, and all subsequent arguments are the material names of the specified block type to generate for. For example, the arguments `sink titanium cobalt osmium` will generate the heat sink jsons `solid_fission_sink_titanium.json`, `solid_fission_sink_cobalt.json` and `solid_fission_sink_osmium.json`.
