Script Addon Block Json Generator
=================================


Summary
-------

A simple program to generate block json files for NCO script addons. The first program argument is the type of block to generate for, and all subsequent arguments are the material names to generate jsons for of the specified block type. For example, the arguments `sink titanium cobalt osmium` will generate the heat sink block jsons `solid_fission_sink_titanium.json`, `solid_fission_sink_cobalt.json` and `solid_fission_sink_osmium.json`.
